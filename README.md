# Optimizing Bank Marketing Strategies
This repository documents a machine learning project that focuses on predicting customer responses to bank marketing campaigns, thereby aiding in the strategic planning and optimization of marketing efforts.

## Project Overview
This analysis compares the performance of various classifiers—k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM)—using data from Portuguese banking marketing campaigns, as sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- The project began with an exploration of the `bank-full.csv` and `bank-additional-full.csv` datasets.
- Descriptive statistics were utilized to gain insights into the data, followed by careful outlier detection and handling.

### Feature Engineering
- Interaction features were developed to capture relationships between variables.
- Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical variables were normalized/standardized.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Four different classifiers were trained.
- Models were evaluated based on several metrics to select the most effective one.

### Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Optimization
- The logistic regression model underwent hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV.
- The optimized model's performance was assessed on the test dataset.

### Results Interpretation
- Feature importance from the logistic regression model was analyzed for insights.
- The findings emphasize features that significantly predict positive campaign responses.

## Code and Explanations
The repository is structured so that all coding is performed first, with explanations following each segment. This approach ensures that the logical flow of the analysis is clear and that the rationale behind each step is fully documented after execution.

## Libraries and Dependencies
To ensure clarity, all libraries and dependencies were imported as needed within the Jupyter Notebook.

### Main Libraries Used:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: Preprocessing and machine learning.

## Repository Structure
- Jupyter Notebook: Contains the detailed analysis, with code preceding explanations for clarity.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for repository use.
